<analysis>
The trajectory details a significant evolution of the apebrain.cloud application, starting with an initial analysis of its MVP features, followed by two major design overhauls. Initially, the AI engineer successfully implemented a dark, mystical theme with glowing red/pink accents, adjusting global CSS (, ) and component-specific styles (). This phase involved iterative CSS modifications and screenshot verifications across landing, shop, and blog pages. The second, more comprehensive phase, triggered by a detailed user request, focused on transforming the entire site to an APEBRAIN Stoned Ape Theory Design. This involved deeply modifying , , and  to incorporate specific branding, quotes, category navigations, and informational sections. The AI engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, iterating through design changes, restarting the frontend, and verifying visual outcomes with screenshots, concluding with backend API integrity checks after the last major UI changes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive redesign of the application to the APEBRAIN Stoned Ape Theory Design. This work followed an initial implementation of a dark, mystical theme. The AI engineer completed the redesign of the Landing Page (), Blog Page (), and Shop Page (). Each page received significant structural and styling updates to align with the new branding, including specific iconography, quotes, taglines, and informational sections.

For the **Landing Page**, a 🍄 + 🧠 icon, APEBRAIN title, CONSCIOUSNESS • MYCOLOGY • EVOLUTION tagline, and a Terence McKenna quote, along with a STONED APE THEORY explanation, were implemented.
The **Blog Page** was transformed into the APEBRAIN Knowledge Portal, featuring the new logo, another Terence McKenna quote, and a detailed category navigation, plus a Join the Consciousness Collective newsletter section.
The **Shop Page** became the APEBRAIN Sacred Shop, with an alternating hero quote (What expanded primate minds can restore yours), new Educational Section and Safety Information Section.

After the Shop Page redesign, a  error occurred during a screenshot attempt. The user then questioned the status of APIs and keys. The AI engineer responded by checking the backend                          RUNNING   pid 37, uptime 0:00:05
